## I. Project Overview

### Project Name:

**PrismPapers** ‚Äì The Transparent Research Publishing and Reviewing Platform

### Brief Project Description:

PrismPapers is a next-generation academic publishing platform that leverages **blockchain** and **MPC (Multi-Party Computation)** to fix the core flaws in traditional publishing‚Äîdelays, high costs, lack of transparency, and poor incentives.

Built on **Solana**, PrismPapers offers fast, low-cost, and censorship-resistant infrastructure for researchers to submit, review, and publish papers openly. Reviews are recorded transparently, and contributors are rewarded with tokens.

With **Arcium Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**, PrismPapers introduces **privacy-preserving peer review**, allowing sensitive review data (like scores, conflict checks, and reviewer identity) to be processed securely‚Äîensuring double-blind anonymity and trust without sacrificing decentralization.

Authors retain full copyright and can monetize their work via **tokenized access** or **optional donations**. Institutions can support their researchers and purchase bulk access for their communities‚Äîall while preserving data confidentiality via MPC.

### This is about making research **faster**, **fairer**, **more transparent**!

---

### Reason for Choosing This Project:

Traditional academic publishing is broken‚Äîit's slow, expensive, and often operates behind closed doors. PrismPapers is my way of rethinking that system. With blockchain and MPC, we can build a model that‚Äôs transparent, open and secure. As someone passionate about solving real-world problems with cutting-edge tech, this project lets me do exactly that.

## II. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Target Audience:

* **Researchers:** Academics seeking a fast, fair, and open way to publish
* **Reviewers:** Experts who want their work to be recognized and rewarded
* **Institutions:** Universities and research orgs seeking affordable access
* **Individual Readers:** Students and professionals accessing research directly

---

### Value Proposition:

| Stakeholder      | Value                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Researchers**  | Quick publishing, copyright ownership, and optional monetization   |
| **Reviewers**    | Token rewards for timely, quality, privacy-protected reviews       |
| **Institutions** | Affordable research access and integration into existing workflows |
| **Readers**      | Paywall-free or low-cost access to cutting-edge academic work      |

---

### Privacy & Trust Features:

* **Encrypted peer review logic** (e.g., scoring, reviewer assignment)
* **Blind review protection** via secure multiparty computation
* **Institutional analytics and usage tracking** without compromising user privacy

---

### Marketing & Distribution:

* Partner with universities, DeSci orgs, and privacy/blockchain communities
* Outreach via LinkedIn, ResearchGate, Twitter
* Host technical blogs, webinars, and DeSci panels
* Demo at academic and Web3 events to attract early adopters
